Idea :

Keeping students records in the blockchain:

Verifying academic credentials is time-consuming, with lots of paper documentation and case-by-case checking. The idea behind keeping students records with blockchain is to save time to educators and administrators when it comes to transfer students between shools or to verify diplomas for employers for example.

Each records of each students could be highly detailed, with, for examples, informations about the courses taken, the certificates obtained, certain marks in certain exams. Those with the access to the student's records could have these informations, other schools (colleges) or employers for example.

Storing these informations could avoid frauds in recruitement sessions for example.

Storing diplomas could be highly useful to share with future employers or schools when and where the student wants, and having a 100% certainess of the validity of the certificate for them with a huge saving in time in the hiring process.

This will help to save a huge amount of time and therefore money.
